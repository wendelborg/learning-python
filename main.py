# Task Tracker - A Python learning project
# Step 1: Basic syntax, variables, f-strings, control flow
#
# Key differences from C#:
# - No braces {} for blocks — indentation matters (4 spaces by convention)
# - No semicolons
# - No explicit types (dynamically typed)
# - print() instead of Console.WriteLine()
# - input() instead of Console.ReadLine()
# - f"..." instead of $"..." for string interpolation


def main():
    print("=== Task Tracker ===")
    print()

    # Variables - no type declaration needed (like 'var' everywhere, but truly dynamic)
    name = input("What's your name? ")

    # f-strings work like C# interpolated strings ($"Hello {name}")
    print(f"\nWelcome, {name}!")
    print()

    # A counter for number of tasks added
    tasks = []  # This will hold our tasks (we'll use it in a future step)

    # A simple loop - note the colon and indentation instead of braces
    # In C#: while (true) { ... }

        print("What would you like to do?")
